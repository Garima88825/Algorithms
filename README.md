# Algorithms

Practicals

1. i. Implement Insertion Sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)
  
  ii. Implement Merge Sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)

2. Implement Heap Sort(The program should report the number of comparisons)

3. Implement Randomized Quick sort (The program should report the number of comparisons)

4. Implement Radix Sort

5. Implement Bucket Sort

6. Implement Randomized Select

7. Implement Breadth-First Search in a graph

8. Implement Depth-First Search in a graph

9. Write a program to determine the minimum spanning tree of a graph (Both Prims and Kruskals)

10. Write a program to determine the LCS of two given sequences

For the algorithms at S.No 1 to 3 test run the algorithm on 100 different inputs of sizes varying from 30 to
1000. Count the number of comparisons and draw the graph. Compare it with a graph of nlogn.
